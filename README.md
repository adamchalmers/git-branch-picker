# git-branch-picker

This is a tiny little micro-project. I spend a lot of time running git branch and looking at my branches, then figuring out which one I want, then switching to it. So I made a tiny little TUI to combine those steps. You select a branch with arrow keys, then press enter to switch to it, or q to exit with no changes.
